# map-of-the-universe
this is an idea from my friend HELLA HUNG of HUNG Dynasties that I made into a code for him. 
Hung believes that this can save the world, but I decided to do this for fun and to get more coding practice in.
As far as I know this code asks you questions that will show you where you are currently in your life and what may be some next steps to improve your position.
Some of the positions it will tell you about is your love life, your career, the people around you, and something that Hung calls a light worker. 
As I gather more information from Hung I will display it here.
